# Sensor_Lights
Having a Red, Yellow, or Green LED turn on or off depending on distance of object that is detected using a microcontroller

Everything besides the Sensor_Lights file was not created by me

Need to add circuit diagram for wiring and parts

To run open the Sensor_Lights file in Arduino IDE and upload to microcontroller with other files in a folder
